### Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
> I had challenges in implementing the YouTubePlayerView, but I leant lots through the process
> I tried to implement some of the bonus points, but faced challenges, and the time constraint did not help me either. 
> My goal will be to implement the extra features to the application as I learn and develop my android development skills. 
> I will use this project as a way to see how I am prgressing through the course.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.
